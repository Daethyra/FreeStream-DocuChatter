    The first chatbot made for FreeStream was RAGbot. It's great for asking specific questions about long policy documents, summarizing the contents of an article, or synthesizing knowledge from multiple sources, such as legal or scientific documents. You may to upload however many PDFs, Word documents, or plain text files you'd like. You can then pose specific questions directly related to the content of your documents.

        1. Upload Documents:  Upload your documents to RAGbot.
        
        2. Document Splitting:  RAGbot splits your documents into chunks for further processing.
        
        3. Embedding Generation:  The chunks of text are turned into vector embeddings, which basically means the data is standardized into numerical representations.
        
        4. Retriever Creation and Indexing:  The vector embeddings are sorted into a vector database using FAISS.
        
        5. Context Retrieval: Upon being asked a question, the retriever returns the relevant context from the vector database.
        
        6. Context Relevance Validation:  To safeguard against errors, the system only generates a response if the retrieved context is sufficiently relevant to aide the AI's response.
        
        7. Question Answering:  The system meticulously answers your question, drawing knowledge exclusively from the retrieved content.

    Curie is perfect for venting your thoughts, getting constructive feedback on something you wrote, helping you make sense of things. Plus you don't have to upload any files. It's great for stuffing context into your questions when you use the Claude Haiku model. Specifically, it's been told to actively assist users in comprehending reality using their curiousity and critical thinking skills. It has a tendency to nudge you towards answers rather than giving them away, which is great for learning.

    In the typical chatbot pages, your AI assistant would perform a set of actions in a linear fashion, one time through. InfoNexus is different because it operates off of a predefined workflow, which allows it to work in cycles, meaning it can decide what to do based on its available set of tools.
    
    For now, it only has the Tavily Search API, which is a "search engine built specifically for AI agents (LLMs), delivering real-time, accurate, and factual results at speed." This chatbot is a work in progress, and currently non-conversational, which means it can only answer questions in a single-shot fashion, and cannot remember previous queries.

    Real-ESRGAN usually powers image upscaling on those websites with free microservices that limit usage before asking for payment or sign up. We'll never do that here. Normally, Real-ESRGAN is capable of upscaling to arbitrary values, however due to the lack of GPU support on Streamlit Community Cloud, the application may crash if you try upscaling too large of an image or too large of a scale factor.
