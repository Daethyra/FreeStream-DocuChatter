    :orange[*FreeStream's RAGbot can answer your questions directly from the documents you provide.*]
    
    This system empowers you to upload PDFs, Word documents, or plain text files. You can then pose specific questions directly related to the content of your documents.  Inspired by AlphaCodium's flow engineering techniques, it works as follows:

    1) Documentation Ingestion:  A long-context LLM carefully processes your uploaded documentation.

    2) Question Answering:  The system meticulously answers your question, drawing knowledge exclusively from the provided documents.

    3) Context Relevance Validation:  To safeguard against errors, the system only generates a response if the retrieved context is sufficiently relevant to aide the AI's response.
    
    ### :blue[Real-ESRGAN]:
    
    :orange[An image upscaler trained on "pure synthetic data." ]
    
    Real-ESRGAN usually powers image upscaling on those websites with free microservices that limit usage before asking for payment or sign up. We'll never do that here. Normally, Real-ESRGAN is capable of upscaling to arbitrary values, however due to the lack of GPU support on Streamlit Community Cloud, the application may crash if you try upscaling too large of an image or too large of a scale factor.
