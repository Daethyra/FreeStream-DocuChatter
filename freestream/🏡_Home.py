    In the typical chatbot pages, your AI assistant would perform a set of actions in a linear fashion, one time through. Tool Executor is different because it operates off of a predefined workflow, which allows it to work in cycles, meaning it can decide to try different things until it is confident it has the right answer.
    
    The AI assistant is therefore an "Agent" because it decides when to use a tool based on its ability to answer the user appropriately. This agent is then operated as a "State machine" in the sense that the underlying large language model changes the contents of the "state" based on the output of a node. Think of nodes as points in the AI's workflow.

    Real-ESRGAN usually powers image upscaling on those websites with free microservices that limit usage before asking for payment or sign up. We'll never do that here. Normally, Real-ESRGAN is capable of upscaling to arbitrary values, however due to the lack of GPU support on Streamlit Community Cloud, the application may crash if you try upscaling too large of an image or too large of a scale factor.
